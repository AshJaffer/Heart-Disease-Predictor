Insights from the Output
Heart Data
Structure:

319,795 entries, 18 columns.
Includes key variables like MentalHealth, PhysicalActivity, SleepTime, and more.
Mental Health and Sleep Insights:

MentalHealth (average of ~3.9 days of poor mental health):
Highly skewed toward lower values (median = 0).
Maximum of 30 days indicates potential outliers.
SleepTime (average of ~7.1 hours):
Mostly within the recommended range of 6-8 hours.
Minimum of 1 hour and maximum of 24 hours suggest possible data quality issues.
Memory Usage:

43.9 MB, manageable for processing.
Sleep and Lifestyle Data
Structure:

374 entries, 13 columns.
Smaller dataset, but rich in lifestyle-related features like sleep_duration, physical_activity_level, stress_level, and daily_steps.
Lifestyle Insights:

sleep_duration: Average of ~7.1 hours, well-aligned with the Heart dataset.
physical_activity_level: Ranges from 30 to 90, indicating variability in activity levels.
stress_level: Average of ~5.4 on a scale (likely 1-10), with potential to study correlations with sleep and activity.
sleep_disorder: 155 non-null values suggest missing data (~41% nulls).
Memory Usage:

Only 38 KB, very light for analysis.
